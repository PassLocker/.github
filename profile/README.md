## üöÄ Overview

**PassLocker** is a modern macOS application built to provide **secure, simple, and reliable password management**. With the increasing number of online accounts, services, and apps we use every day, remembering dozens (or even hundreds) of credentials has become almost impossible. PassLocker solves this problem by acting as your **encrypted digital vault**, storing all your passwords, PINs, and sensitive notes in one place.

Instead of relying on insecure text files, browser autofill quirks, or memory tricks, PassLocker ensures your data is **protected with strong encryption algorithms**, so only you can access it. The app features an intuitive interface where you can quickly add, edit, and organize your credentials into categories.  

PassLocker also includes **auto-lock mechanisms**, customizable password generators, and a seamless search function, allowing you to find the right login in seconds. Unlike cloud-only solutions, PassLocker offers **local storage options**, so privacy-conscious users can keep their vault offline while still benefiting from synchronization options (iCloud, Dropbox, or local backups) if needed.

Whether you‚Äôre managing accounts for personal use, business operations, or shared environments, PassLocker is designed to adapt to different workflows. It gives you peace of mind, knowing your credentials are safe but always within reach when needed.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

PassLocker was created to provide a **balance between robust security and everyday usability**. Many password managers either overwhelm users with overly complex features or fail to provide sufficient protection. PassLocker focuses on what truly matters: keeping your secrets safe and making them accessible only to you.

The app uses **AES-256 encryption** to protect your vault, one of the strongest standards available today. Your master password is never stored ‚Äî meaning even if the device is compromised, no one can access your accounts without your key.  

The interface was designed with simplicity in mind: clean layouts, category tagging, and visual clarity help users quickly organize logins for banking, social media, work platforms, or personal sites.  

PassLocker also integrates well with macOS, offering system notifications, biometric authentication (Touch ID/Face ID on supported Macs), and smooth performance with both Intel and Apple Silicon. With **automatic backups, export/import tools, and syncing support**, your passwords remain both secure and portable.

In short, PassLocker is not just a storage tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **trustworthy security companion** that makes managing your digital identity easier while keeping it private.
